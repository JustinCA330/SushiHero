## Second Game Choice : Sushi Restaurant Simulator (self-chosen)

##### To RUN:  
Once the project has been imported into NetBeans, build the project by clicking the icon with the hammer (Build Project) or the icon with the hammer and broom (Clean and Build Project), then the icon with the green play button (Run Project).

##### To PLAY:
You control both the chef (ASDW) and the prep (arrow keys). At the top right, the current order is displayed. The prep must begin by grabbing the correct ingredients, for example to make an avocado roll (avocado + seaweed + rice) in any order, but one at a time. As the prep delivers each ingredient the chef will now have them and be able to prepare them by either chopping them or putting the rice in the rice cooker. When all ingredients are chopped and the rice is cooked, the chef can now deliver it to the counter (leftmost table). 

There is a bug in which the chef can only collide with the top part of the counter.
If all ingredients are chopped and the rice is cooked, and if the chef collides with the counter, the price of the roll is added to the score.
